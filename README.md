# Ownership Server

The ownership server was designed to expose an API that resolves NFT ownership, acting as an intermediary between a database hosting ownership data (such as Substreams or Subsquid) and a consumer, like a Catalyst node. This approach reduces reliance on services like The Graph or Satsuma, enhancing ownership validation time.
